# About DirSize

DirSize is a Windows tool that allows users to see the data distribution in their directory. The stats are represented in a list aided by a pie chart for ease of understanding. You can hover over the pie chart to see the distribution as well. This application is written completely in C#.

To use DirSize, download and install the latest release from the release section. For alpha releases, you will have to manually edit the registry to make it available in the context menu. DirSize currently requires .NET version 4.5 and above.
